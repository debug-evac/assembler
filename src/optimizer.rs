// Optional optimizer that tries to reduce NOOP operations and
// maximizes parallelization (in the pipeline) of operations.
// Relevant techniques include register renaming, instruction
// scheduling, peephole optimization (reduction of certain
// operations into shoter-running operations), among other
// things. This will run on every compilation (? rather
// translations), however changes to the programm will only be
// made, if the programmer includes an (or possibly a number of)
// flag(s). If there are no flags, the assembler will simply
// issue a notice that performance COULD be gained if
// restructuring the assembly code (can be suppressed by
// another flag).
